You must know standard university-level math. You can review those concepts in the first chapters of the book [Deep learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/):
* Deep learning, chapter 2: [Linear algebra](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/complete-guide-to-deep-learning/blob/master/Prerequisites/linear_algebra.pdf)
* Deep learning, chapter 3: [Probability and information theory](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/complete-guide-to-deep-learning/blob/master/Prerequisites/probability-and-information-theory.pdf)
* Deep learning, chapter 4: [Numerical computation](https://github.com/khanhnamle1994/complete-guide-to-deep-learning/blob/master/Prerequisites/numerical-computation.pdf)

You must know programming to develop and test deep learning models. We suggest using Python for machine learning. NumPy/SciPy libraries for scientific computing are required.
