Machine learning is the art and science of teaching computers based on data. It is a relatively established field at the intersection of computer science and mathematics, while deep learning is just a small subfield of it. The concepts and tools of machine learning are important for understanding deep learning.

Most of the popular machine learning algorithms are implemented in the Scikit-learn Python library. Implementing some of them from scratch helps with understanding how machine learning works.

* [Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/) covers linear regression, k-nearest-neighbors and support vector machines. First it shows how to use them from scikit-learn, then implements the algorithms from scratch.
* Andrew Ng's course on Coursera has many assignments in Octave language. The same algorithms can be implemented in Python.
