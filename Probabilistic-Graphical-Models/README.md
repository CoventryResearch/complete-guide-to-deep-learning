Higher level frameworks (Lasagne, Keras) do not implement graphical models. But there is a lot of code for Theano, Tensorflow and Torch.
* [Restricted Boltzmann Machines in Theano](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rbm.html)
* [Deep Belief Networks in Theano](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/DBN.html)
* [Generating Large Images from Latent Vectors](http://blog.otoro.net/2016/04/01/generating-large-images-from-latent-vectors/) - uses a combination of variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.
* [Image Completion with Deep Learning in TensorFlow](https://bamos.github.io/2016/08/09/deep-completion/) - another application of generative adversarial networks.
* [Generating Faces with Torch](http://torch.ch/blog/2015/11/13/gan.html) - Torch implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks
